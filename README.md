CMAC's website. Built with Next.js with TypeScript and Tailwind.

## Run Locally

`npm run dev`

Then visit localhost:3000

## Quick Notes

I'm using Next.js because I may occasionally need server components + it's very easy to deploy to Vercel.

I do not plan on writing the actual backend here because I hate TypeScript, so see the Golang
backend for that.
